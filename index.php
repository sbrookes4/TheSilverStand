    <p class="titleA">Our Mission</p>

    <p class="textA">
    Our mission is to provide great service and silver products, help educate people on the true value of silver and to promote the use of and saving of silver in all its wonderful forms!
    <br>
    <br>
    An ideal world would once again have us using silver (and gold) in daily transactions and savings and we want to support that vision - or at least help those who know the true value of silver.
    </p>

    <p class="titleA">Education</p>

    <p class="textA">
    The Silver Stand, along with many others, want to spread the Gospel and Praises of silver. While The Silver Stand cannot give financial advice, we certainly wish to help people and our customers learn about silver.
    <br>
    <br>
    The more you know about our financial system, how money works and about the true value of precious metals, the more financially empowered you will become!
