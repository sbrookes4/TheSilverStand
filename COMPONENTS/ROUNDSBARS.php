    <p class="titleA">Rounds & Bars</p>

    <p class="textA"><b>The First Time...</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    The first time a person holds a 1 ounce silver bar or round in their hand, having known nothing but debit cards, cash and checks as payment and 'money', the weight of that 1 ounce - the feel of that bar or round - it's initial coolness, its shininess -  at that moment something happens - a realization, a weighty connection, something primal occurs.
    <br>
    <br>
    For many, it leads to discovery and a whole new outlook and understanding - everything changes... that's what The Silver Stand is all about - getting silver into the hands of more Americans everyday, changing their lives and empowering them with silver! 
    <br>
    <br>
    There are so many bars and rounds to choose from - but certainly you are going to want to have many beloved Silver Eagles and sweet Canadian Maple Leafs…the gorgeous Silver Britannias…the so nicely stackable bars with their mirror finish…watch out – it may become an obsession!  
    <br>
    <br>
    We certainly hope so!
